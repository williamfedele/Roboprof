"he course introduces students to the concept of quantum mechanics and the electronic structure of atoms and molecules. Topics include the origins and postulates of quantum theory, the Schr√∂dinger equation and applications to simple systems such as the harmonic oscillator, rigid rotor and the hydrogen atom. The course looks at the quantum mechanical treatment of the chemical bond and provides an introduction to spectroscopy."
